# PokeBattle

  PokeBattle was created for Pokemon lovers like me, I play Pokemon from the Gameboy Classic to the current Nitendo consoles, the old games from the Pokemon franchise were my aspiration for creating this game and design also.

- The Game 
   - The game will give you three cards with three different pokemons. The card will have three attributes and each attribute has a value linked to it. The winner will be the one who scores the most points when they reach round twenty one and the game ends. each round is equivalent to one point each round you must choose your pokemon's attribute and battle until the last round.

- How the Game Works
  - As soon as the player selects the start game menu option the game will open you will see a start button when you press the game it will draw three cards for the player and three cards for the CPU each round you must choose an attribute among your three pokemons and click in the attribute value to continue the battle.
The winner will be the one with the highest value of the chosen attribute.
At the end of twenty-one rounds the value of the player's points will be compared and his opponent, the winner of the game will be the one with the most points.

  - The Game Over window will appear when the game reaches twenty one rounds and the player will be able to see the result and also the final score he achieved.When the player clicks on the gameover button, he will be directed to the main page where he can start the game again or change the game theme.

- Tips and funfacts
 - Each Pokemon card will only be allowed to be used once, so be smart and select the highest tribute value. At the end of the round, your card will be turned over and your opponent's card will be turned over and reveals the card that the CPU selected. Don't stay if you get a strong pokemon, the values are random for all pokemons so don't be scared if you get MewTwo and your opponent defeats you with a Metapoid.

## Testing 

During my project I encountered certain challenges that I had to overcome, such as the page layout using flexbox and with my nav button, the website is fully responsive on tablets, laptops and large screens.
At the beginning of the project I should have made more commits at each stage of my project, but I wasn't, after advice from my Tutor I started to make my commits frequently as I progressed during my project.
