  PokeBattle was created for Pokemon lovers like me, I play Pokemon from the Gameboy Classic to the current Nitendo consoles, the old games from the Pokemon franchise were my aspiration for creating this game and design also.

- How the Game Works
  - As soon as the player selects the start game menu option the game will open you will see a start button when you press the game it will draw three cards for the player and three cards for the CPU each round you must choose an attribute among your three pokemons and click in the attribute value to continue the battle.
The winner will be the one with the highest value of the chosen attribute.
At the end of twenty-one rounds the value of the player's points will be compared and his opponent, the winner of the game will be the one with the most points.

- Game Over
  - The Game Over window will appear when the game reaches twenty one rounds and the player will be able to see the result and also the final score he achieved.When the player clicks on the gameover button, he will be directed to the main page where he can start the game again or change the game theme.

- Tips and funfacts
 - Each Pokemon card will only be allowed to be used once, so be smart and select the highest tribute value. At the end of the round, your card will be turned over and your opponent's card will be turned over and reveals the card that the CPU selected. Don't stay if you get a strong pokemon, the values are random for all pokemons so don't be scared if you get MewTwo and your opponent defeats you with a Metapoid.

## Future Ideas to Implement 

- SuperCards
- Rank System 
- Expand Pokemons add add first second and third generation of pokemon
- System of levels Hard Normal and Easy
 

## Testing 

During my project I set the objective of making a pokemon game with a first generation of 150 pokemons. The first challenge was to create a system that would generate a random value for each attribute and assign it to all 150 pokemons.
After this challenge, the gameplay would come, so I created a number comparison system that in the end would compare the highest value of the attribute. To test the gameplay, I had my eight-year-old son play and explore the game.I also put my wife to play and it was vitally important for someone who is not familiar with games. 
The game will guide you how to play, for players who still have questions about how to play, I have implemented a how to play section.
I had a lot of problems with the game mechanics when adding events and how to compare the selected object. These problems helped me learn how the event click system works best and the type of variable we should use, but the biggest challenge was making the CPU selects a random card and a random attribute value without repeating for the entire cycle after that the array system was absorbed by me.
